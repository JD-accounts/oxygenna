<p class="md-subhead">Toasts provide lightweight feedback about an operation. They show a brief message at the bottom of the screen on mobile and lower left on desktop. Toasts appear above all other elements on screen. Toasts can contain an action.</p>

<p>They automatically disappear after a timeout or after user interaction elsewhere on the screen, particularly after interactions that summon a new surface or activity. Toasts can be swiped off screen. They do not block input on the screens on which they appear. Show only one snackbar on screen at a time.</p>
