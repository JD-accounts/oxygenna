    <p class="md-subhead">Sliders let users select a value from a continuous or discrete range of values by moving the slider thumb. The smallest value is to the left, the largest to the right. Sliders can have icons to the left and right of the bar that reflect the value intensity. The interactive nature of the slider makes it a great choice for settings that reflect intensity levels, such as volume, brightness, or color saturation.</p>

    <p>Use continuous sliders for subjective settings that do not require a specific value for the user to make meaningful adjustments.</p>
