<div class="padded-content-page">
    <p class="md-subhead">Make loading content in your app as delightful and painless as possible by minimizing the amount of visual change a user sees before they can view and interact with content. Each operation should only be represented by one activity indicatorâ€”for example, one refresh operation should not display both a refresh bar and an activity circle.</p>

    <p>There are two types of indicators: linear and circular. You can use either one for determinate and indeterminate operations.</p>

    <h2 class="md-headline">Linear</h2>
