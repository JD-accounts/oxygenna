<p class="md-subhead">A card is a piece of paper that contains unique related data; for example, a photo, text, and link all about a single subject. Cards are typically an entry point to more complex and detailed information.</p>

<p>Cards have a constant width and variable height. The maximum height is limited to what can fit within a single view on a platform, but it can temporarily expand as needed (for example, to display a comment field).  Cards do not flip to reveal information on their back.</p>
