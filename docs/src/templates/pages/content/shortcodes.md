# Row

One of the great features of {{theme.name}} theme is the use of multiple **page sections**. Think of a section as a partial in your page that you can add any type of content:


Each section can host its own content.
Before adding content to a new page, make sure you have created a new row.
Turn the **Visual composer** on by clicking on the  **Backend editor** button:

Then you can start adding elements inside a row(section). Press the **Add element** button.

You have created an empty section. Before adding new elements to that section, try to edit it by clicking on the small pencil icon that is located on the upper right corner of the newly created row.
