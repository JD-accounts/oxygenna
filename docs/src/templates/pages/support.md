# Our Support Policy
We are always happy to help anyone who is experiencing problems with our themes. We have a dedicated support team ready to help you with any problems you may encounter.

To get in touch with our support team you need to visit our <a href="{{links.support}}" target="_blank">support forum</a>. Support is limited to questions regarding the themeâ€™s features or problems with the theme. We do not support general Wordpress problems or 3rd party plugins you have installed. Also, it is important that you have read the documentation for the item purchased from our  <a href="{{links.doclibrary}}" target="_blank">Documentation Library</a>.

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">We will always respond to tickets as soon as we can. Our office working hours are <strong>9:00 - 17:00 EET Monday - Friday</strong></div>

## What is Customization
<i class="fa fa-cogs"></i> Customization is trying to achieve something that is not covered by the theme's options, therefore falls outside of the scope of our support service. We would suggest hiring a freelance developer and we would gladly help him with any questions he might have about {{theme.name}}.

# Getting Support
