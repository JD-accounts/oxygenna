# Customizing the side menu

Triangular comes with both a service and a provider for setting the items in the sidemenu.

- **triMenuProvider** - Allows you to set your menu items at the config stage of angularjs.
- **triMenu** - This service allows you to change your sidemenu at runtime in controllers.
